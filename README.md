# 🚀 Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG) 🧠

An implementation of Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG) from scratch, with insights on its advantages, limitations, and future enhancements.

## 📓 Notebook Overview

- **File:** `cag.ipynb`
- **Purpose:** Implements the Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG) strategy from scratch.

## ✨ Features

| Feature                | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚡ **Reduced Latency**  | Faster response times by eliminating retrieval delays.                      |
| 📚 **Simplified Architecture** | Streamlined workflow without complex retrieval mechanisms.               |
| 🔄 **Enhanced Consistency** | Provides reliable access to preselected, known relevant information.    |
| 🚀 **Improved Efficiency** | Avoids redundant retrieval steps, reducing computational overhead.       |
| 🔒 **Consistent Outputs** | Ensures uniform outputs by maintaining the same context for all queries. |
| 🔧 **Streamlined Workflow** | Simplifies the transition from a query-retrieve-generate pipeline to a query-generate process. |
| 🏆 **Enhanced Performance** | Provides faster and more accurate responses with relevant preloaded information in memory. |

## ⚠️ Limitations

| Limitation                | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧠 **Context Window Limit** | Limited by the context window size of language models, making it unsuitable for expansive knowledge bases. |
| 📉 **Static Knowledge**    | Struggles to adapt to rapidly changing information outside its cached context. |
| 💰 **Higher Upfront Cost** | Requires preprocessing and caching all data, leading to higher initial operational costs. |
| ❌ **Inflexibility**       | Difficult to manage out-of-context or unexpected queries.                   |
| 🔓 **Security Concerns**   | Preloaded data stored in memory poses potential security risks.             |
| 💾 **Data Storage**        | Large preloaded contexts demand significant storage space.                  |

## 🔮 Future Approach

### Addressing CAG's Challenges:

1. **Dynamic Context Window Management 🧠**

2. **Optimized Storage Solutions 💾**

3. **Improved Query Flexibility 🔄**

4. **Cost Optimization 💰**

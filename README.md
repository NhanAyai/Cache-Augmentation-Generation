## Features

| Feature                | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚡ **Reduced Latency**  | Faster response times by eliminating retrieval delays.                      |
| 📚 **Simplified Architecture** | Streamlined workflow without complex retrieval mechanisms.               |
| 🔄 **Enhanced Consistency** | Provides reliable access to preselected, known relevant information.    |
| 🚀 **Improved Efficiency** | Avoids redundant retrieval steps, reducing computational overhead.       |
| 🔒 **Consistent Outputs** | Ensures uniform outputs by maintaining the same context for all queries. |
| 🔧 **Streamlined Workflow** | Simplifies the transition from a query-retrieve-generate pipeline to a query-generate process. |
| 🏆 **Enhanced Performance** | Provides faster and more accurate responses with relevant preloaded information in memory. |

## Limitations

| Limitation                | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧠 **Context Window Limit** | Limited by the context window size of language models, making it unsuitable for expansive knowledge bases. |
| 📉 **Static Knowledge**    | Struggles to adapt to rapidly changing information outside its cached context. |
| 💰 **Higher Upfront Cost** | Requires preprocessing and caching all data, leading to higher initial operational costs. |
| ❌ **Inflexibility**       | Difficult to manage out-of-context or unexpected queries.                   |
| 🔓 **Security Concerns**   | Preloaded data stored in memory poses potential security risks.             |
| 💾 **Data Storage**        | Large preloaded contexts demand significant storage space.                  |

## Future Approach

### Addressing CAG's Challenges:

- **Dynamic Context Window Management:**
  - Explore model architectures that can dynamically adjust context windows.
  - Investigate chunking and hierarchical memory mechanisms.

- **Real-Time Adaptation:**
  - Combine CAG with real-time retrieval for hybrid workflows.
  - Implement update mechanisms to reflect rapidly changing data.

- **Optimized Storage Solutions:**
  - Explore compression techniques to reduce memory requirements.
  - Leverage cloud-based, secure storage for preloaded contexts.

- **Improved Query Flexibility:**
  - Train fallback systems to handle out-of-context or unexpected queries.

- **Security Enhancements:**
  - Use encryption for preloaded data to mitigate risks.
  - Introduce access control mechanisms for sensitive information.
